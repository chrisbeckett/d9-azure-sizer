Microsoft Azure SDK for Python
==============================

This is the Microsoft Azure Subscription Management Client Library.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the next generation of management APIs that
replace the old Azure Service Management (ASM).

This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

For the older Azure Service Management (ASM) libraries, see
`azure-servicemanagement-legacy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy>`__ library.

For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the `azure <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure>`__ bundle package.


Usage
=====

For code examples, see `Subscription Management
<https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/>`__
on docs.microsoft.com.

Release History
===============

0.5.0 (2019-08-21)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Added operation SubscriptionsOperations.enable
- Added operation group SubscriptionOperationOperations
- Added operation group SubscriptionOperations
- Added operation group SubscriptionFactoryOperations

**General Breaking changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes if from some import.
In summary, some modules were incorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the first place.

- SubscriptionClient cannot be imported from `azure.mgmt.subscription.subscription_client` anymore (import from `azure.mgmt.subscription` works like before)
- SubscriptionClientConfiguration import has been moved from `azure.mgmt.subscription.subscription_client` to `azure.mgmt.subscription`
- A model `MyClass` from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported anymore using `azure.mgmt.subscription.models.my_class` (import from `azure.mgmt.subscription.models` works like before)
- An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations` sub-module cannot be imported anymore using `azure.mgmt.subscription.operations.my_class_operations` (import from `azure.mgmt.subscription.operations` works like before)

Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default. You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or use no more than one client per process.
